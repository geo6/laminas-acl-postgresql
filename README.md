# [Zend Permissions ACL](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-permissions-acl/) with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## Install

    composer require geo6/zend-acl-postgresql

### Database structure

See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)

> For the purposes of this documentation:
>
>    a **resource** is an object to which access is controlled.
>    a **role** is an object that may request access to a **resource**.
>
> Put simply, **roles request access to resources**. For example, if a parking attendant requests access to a car, then the parking attendant is the requesting role, and the car is the resource, since access to the car may not be granted to everyone.
